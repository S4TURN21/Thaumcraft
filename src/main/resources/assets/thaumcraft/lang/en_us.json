  "research.FIRSTSTEPS.stage.1": "Who would have thought that a few sprinkles of dust could have created this marvellous book? It is mostly blank, but it hints at a powerful new form of magic: Thaumaturgy.<BR>Firstly I will need to study the magical world that has been shown to me. For that I will need a tool - a Thaumometer the book calls it.<BR>A normal crafting table won't do however since the magical energies I need to channel while crafting it are quite delicate. A sprinkling of Salis Mundus on a mundane crafting table should solve that. The book has taught me the proper incantation to use so it should be a simple matter.<BR>To keep myself on track I will make a list of all the requirements that need to be met on the first page of each new entry.",
  "research.FIRSTSTEPS.stage.2": "Progress! I now have an Arcane Workbench at my disposal. It works much like a mundane crafting table and can even be used as such, however there are a few key differences.<BR>Firstly, many arcane recipes will require the use of those vis crystals I've been finding of late. They act as a focus for the magical energy I need to channel into the items I craft. The book calls this magical energy Vis.<BR>Supposedly this energy is all around me, but as yet I cannot perceive or measure it.<BR>It is time I craft the Thaumometer and use it to study the world around me. It should clearly mark those things I still need to examine.<BR>I have placed a bookmark to the Thaumometer recipe on the right.",
  "research.FIRSTSTEPS.stage.3": "Such strange wonders are being revealed to me. Peering through the lens of the Thaumometer shows me a world coursing with magic, Vis as the books calls it.<BR>Normally this energy is a pure ocean of magic that ebbs and flows, but it also permeates all things, both animate and inanimate. The book calls Vis in this state Essentia. Where Vis is formless and pure, Essentia is more rigid in its nature and falls into a multitude of clearly defined types, each mixing together with others to form greater and more complex types of essentia.<BR>I am not quite sure if the matter it is bound to gives Essentia its nature, or that the very nature of matter depends on the Essentia it contains. This bears further study.<BR>I am keeping a log of all the types of essentia I discover. A bookmark on the left will show my current knowledge.<BR>For now I need to focus my energies elsewhere. Studying essentia might be a good place to start.",
  "research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.title": "Types of Knowledge",
  "research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.stage.1": "There are two main types of knowledge: Observations and Theories. They are further subdivided into the main research categories like Alchemy and Artifice.<LINE>§lObservations§r are notes and discoveries you have made in the real world by scanning objects. Practical observation often give insights into how things work and by keeping field notes of those observations you will slowly build a solid base of knowledge to work from.<LINE>§lTheories§r, in a nutshell, are ways of understanding things through careful observation, rational thought and practical experimentation. Much of thaumaturgical research requires crafting theories to better understand research categories.",
